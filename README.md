# Portfolio Website for a UX/UI & Frontend engineer

This website serves as a portfolio to showcase UX/UI & Frontend projects me and my friend have under our belt. However, at its core the website is being implemented to learn and practice several things such as:
- TypeScript: Programming language
- MUI: Material User Interface Library
- tsParticles: Library to create particle animations
- react-spring: Physics based animation library
- AOS: Animate on scroll library for animations
- Firebase integration

The technologies being used to develop the website have been chosen on the basis of their popularity in today's world. As my frontend developer journey continues, I will keep updating this website with new technologies that I want to learn.

## How to run

To run the project on your local machine, carry out the following steps:
- Clone repository to a local folder.
- Open project in your preferred IDE (I use VSCode)
- Open terminal and run the 'npm install' command to install all dependencies.
- Run the 'npm start' command.
- 'Go to your browser and type 'http://localhost:3000/' on URL bar.
